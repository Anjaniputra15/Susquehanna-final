# Advanced Trading Algorithm for Algothon Quant Competition

## Overview

This is a sophisticated quantitative trading algorithm designed for the Algothon Quant competition. The algorithm implements a multi-strategy ensemble approach that combines momentum, mean reversion, volatility, and technical indicators to generate optimal trading positions.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Competition Compliance**
- âœ… Function signature: `getMyPosition(prices)` with correct input/output format
- âœ… Position limits: $10,000 maximum per instrument
- âœ… Commission awareness: 5 bps (0.0005) transaction costs
- âœ… Runtime optimization: Under 10 minutes execution time
- âœ… Integer positions: All positions returned as integers
- âœ… Robust error handling: Graceful fallback to zero positions

### ðŸ§  **Advanced Strategy Components**

#### 1. **Multi-Period Momentum Strategy**
- Calculates momentum signals across multiple lookback periods (5, 10, 20, 50 days)
- Uses Savitzky-Golay smoothing for signal refinement
- Adapts to different market timeframes

#### 2. **Mean Reversion Strategy**
- Identifies overbought/oversold conditions using moving averages
- Volatility-adjusted mean reversion signals
- Multiple lookback periods for robust signal generation

#### 3. **Volatility-Based Strategy**
- Detects volatility regimes and breakout opportunities
- Low volatility = mean reversion opportunities
- High volatility = momentum opportunities

#### 4. **Technical Indicators**
- **RSI-like indicator**: Relative strength index for overbought/oversold detection
- **Bollinger Bands**: Price position relative to volatility bands
- **MACD-like**: Moving average convergence/divergence
- **Price acceleration**: Second derivative of price movement

#### 5. **Risk Management**
- Position size optimization based on signal strength
- Maximum 15 active positions for diversification
- Commission-aware trading to minimize transaction costs
- Dynamic risk adjustment based on market conditions

### ðŸ“Š **Signal Generation Process**

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Calculate log returns and volatility
   - Handle edge cases and missing data
   - Normalize signals for consistency

2. **Multi-Strategy Ensemble**
   - Combine signals with weighted averaging:
     - Momentum: 25%
     - Mean Reversion: 25%
     - Volatility: 15%
     - Technical: 20%
     - Risk: 15%

3. **Portfolio Optimization**
   - Select top 15 instruments by signal strength
   - Apply risk-adjusted position sizing
   - Ensure position limits compliance

4. **Position Finalization**
   - Apply $10k position limits
   - Convert to integer positions
   - Update algorithm state

## Usage

```python
from main import getMyPosition
import numpy as np

# Example usage
prices = np.random.rand(50, 100) * 100 + 50  # 50 instruments, 100 days
positions = getMyPosition(prices)
print(f"Positions: {positions}")
```

## Competition Submission
